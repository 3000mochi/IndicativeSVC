# Introduction
Indicative Support Vector Clustering is an extension to
original SVC algorithm by integrating user given labels. The work is
based on the publication in [1].

# Requirements
- **Matlab 2013b or newer**
- [CVX Matlab](http://cvxr.com/cvx/ )
- [Statistical Pattern Recognistion Toolbox](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/cmp/software/stprtool/)
